# Skin Cancer Detector

This project's motivation is to improve accessibility  of skin cancer screening by partially automating the process with only using image data and CNN(convolutional neural network)

The data I used is: https://challenge.isic-archive.com/data isic challenge the 2019 version of it.

and I have modified the data since the dateset was badly imbalanced. if you want my dataset, click this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1j_vynkQ33ISnpRXTBIxrtefkdPIYA7cx/view?usp=sharing
The modified data evened out the amount of data for each classes to {0: 2500, 1: 2500, 2: 2500, 3: 2500, 4: 2500, 5: 2500, 6: 2500, 7: 2500} by oversampling and undersampling.

here is the link of my final model: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1cIe7az90W3p3sUX3kU62kQ5ZJyd-Xi3a/view?usp=sharing

app.py file runs with streamlit.
